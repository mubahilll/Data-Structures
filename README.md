# Data Structures Implementations

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in C++.

## Files

1. **`stacks.cpp`**: Implements a basic stack data structure using a linked list.
   - Provides functionalities like push, pop, top, isEmpty.

2. **`circularlist.cpp`**: Implements a circular linked list data structure.
   - Provides functionalities like insertion at head, tail, any position, removal from head, tail, specific node, printing, and traversal.

3. **`doublelinklist.cpp`**: Implements a doubly linked list data structure.
   - Provides functionalities like insertion at head, tail, any position, removal from head, tail, specific node, printing, and traversal.

4. **`josephusproblem.cpp`**: Implements the Josephus Problem using a circular linked list.
   - Solves the problem of finding the last person remaining after every mth person is eliminated in a circle of n people.

5. **`singlelinklist.cpp`**: Implements a singly linked list data structure.
   - Provides functionalities like insertion at head, tail, any position, removal from head, tail, specific node, printing, and traversal.
     
6. **`stacks_using_link_list.cpp`**: Implements a stack data structure using a linked list.
   - Provides functionalities like push, pop, peek, isEmpty, sizeStack, and display.

7. **`stacks_template.cpp`**: Implements a stack data structure using templates.
   - Provides functionalities like push, pop, peek, isEmpty, sizeStack, and display.

8. **`selection_sort.cpp`**: This program implements the selection sort algorithm.
   - It generates a list of random numbers, sorts them using selection sort, and writes the sorted list into a file named `sorted.txt`.

9. **`merge_sort.cpp`**: This program implements the merge sort algorithm.
   - It generates a list of random numbers, sorts them using merge sort, and writes the sorted list into a file named `m_sort.txt`.
10. **`avl_tree.cpp`**: This program implements an AVL tree, a self-balancing binary search tree.
    - It allows insertion, deletion, and searching operations on the AVL tree.
    - The tree can be traversed using various traversal methods such as pre-order, in-order, post-order, and level-order traversal.
    - Additionally, it provides functionality to print the AVL tree in a 2D format.

11. **`binary_search_tree`**: This program implements a basic binary search tree (BST) data structure.
    - It allows insertion, deletion, searching, and minimum finding operations on the BST.
    - The program also demonstrates in-order traversal of the binary search tree.

12. **`queue.cpp`**: This program implements a queue data structure using a linked list.
    - It provides functionality for enqueue, dequeue, and checking if the queue is empty.

14. **`queue_array.cpp`**: This program implements a queue data structure using an array.
    - It provides functionality for enqueue, dequeue, checking if the queue is empty or full, and accessing the front element.

## Usage

Each `.cpp` file can be compiled and executed individually to see the functionalities of the implemented data structures. Simply compile using a C++ compiler and run the executable.

Example:

```bash
g++ stacks.cpp -o stacks
./stacks
```
