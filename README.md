# Data Structures Implementations

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in C++.

## Files

1. **stacks.cpp**: Implements a basic stack data structure using a linked list.
   - Provides functionalities like push, pop, top, isEmpty.

2. **circularlist.cpp**: Implements a circular linked list data structure.
   - Provides functionalities like insertion at head, tail, any position, removal from head, tail, specific node, printing, and traversal.

3. **doublelinklist.cpp**: Implements a doubly linked list data structure.
   - Provides functionalities like insertion at head, tail, any position, removal from head, tail, specific node, printing, and traversal.

4. **josephusproblem.cpp**: Implements the Josephus Problem using a circular linked list.
   - Solves the problem of finding the last person remaining after every mth person is eliminated in a circle of n people.

5. **singlelinklist.cpp**: Implements a singly linked list data structure.
   - Provides functionalities like insertion at head, tail, any position, removal from head, tail, specific node, printing, and traversal.

## Usage

Each `.cpp` file can be compiled and executed individually to see the functionalities of the implemented data structures. Simply compile using a C++ compiler and run the executable.

Example:

```bash
g++ stacks.cpp -o stacks
./stacks
```
